<h2> About Me </h2>
<p> Languages: C++, C, Java </p>
<p> 
I was born in Fountain Valley, California and was raised in Tustin and Irvine.
I graduated at Irvine High School in 2016 and started at Irvine Valley College.
Going into community college, I did not know what I wanted to do until 3 sememster
later when I took my first coding class at Saddleback College. Enjoying the experience,
I ambitiously continue to push myself to learn and prepare for the next level. Refining
my coding, problem solving, and collaboration skills contributed to much of my success. 
Currently I am at Cal State Fullerton working tirelessly on my undergraduate program in 
Computer Science.
